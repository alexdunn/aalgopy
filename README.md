## About
This is a collection of algorithms written in Python 3.  Many of the algorithms are from the textbook *The Algorithm Design Manual*.

## Test

## Tools

### Working Automatically
- pep8 = A linter and standards adherence tool.  I'm ignoring pep8's requirement that all lines of code are not to be longer than 80 characters.
- pyflakes = A linter. This is integrated into the IDE as I edit code.
- pylint = This is integrated into the IDE as I edit code.
- mccabe = A code complexity static analyzer.  This is integrated into the IDE as I edit code.

### Planned
- Travis CI = Continuous integration that builds and runs the project every time commits are pushed to GitHub.
- Coveralls = Track how well the code is covered by unit tests. This is updated automatically by Travis CI.
- Landscape = Static analysis and code quality.
- Code Climate = Test coverage, style, quality, and security analysis.
- Codacy = Static analysis and code quality.
